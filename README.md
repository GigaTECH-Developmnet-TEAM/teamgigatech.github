## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the homepage.

3. All styles and scripts are loaded locally from the `css/`, `js/`, and `lib/` folders.

## Customization

- Edit SCSS files in `scss/` for advanced style changes. Compile to CSS as needed.
- Add or replace images in the `img/` folder.
- Update or add JavaScript in `js/main.js` for custom functionality.

## Notes
